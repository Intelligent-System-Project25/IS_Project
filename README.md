# IS_Project

# Problem Statement:
This project aims to predict whether the rise in CO2 emissions leads to higher global temperatures increases the likelihood of a tropical storm occurring while identifying any other patterns/trends in the datasets. This will be done by using historical data from the datasets all collected from Kaggle.
